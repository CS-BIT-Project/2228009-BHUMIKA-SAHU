> 🍀 “Catch Plant Problems Before They Grow”  
> LeafScan is a deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images and provides prevention tips and supplement suggestions to improve plant health.

---

## 🔍 About the Project

LeafScan uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify plant diseases from images uploaded by users. The system is built using **Flask** (Python backend) and **Bootstrap** (frontend), making it lightweight, fast, and user-friendly.

🧠 Powered by AI,  
📸 Driven by Image Classification,  
🌱 Designed for farmers, gardeners, and plant lovers.
